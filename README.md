# Design Pattern w/ Java
Placing distinction on writing high quality code. Not good enough to just produce the correct output, but code that is easy to maintain, properly cohesive and loosely coupled.

### Structure
* Overview of DP
* Benefits of DP (why use DP?)
* Types of DP: Each identifies a subset of pattern that can be used to solve specific problems
    * Creational - creating instances of objects
    * Behavioral - patterns in objects' communication
    * Structural - structure of object
* Important Design Principles and strategies related to Design Patterns (in Java): All the design patterns are going to employ these principles and strategies to relate the Design Patterns to these concepts. DP uses design principles. So basically, the characteristics of DP.
    * Design Smells: things seen in code that tells there's a problem with the design
    * Programming to an interface
    * Composition over Inheritance
    * Delegation Principles
    * Single Responsibility (Cohesion): objects should do small focused thing
    * Open-Closed Principle: objects are open for extension (extensibility), but close for modification
    * Liskov Substitution Principle
    * Interface Segregation Principle
    * Dependency Injection and Dependency Inversion
* UML
    * class diagrams
    * object-oriented concepts in UML (inheritance, interfaces, composition, annotation)
* Creational DP
    * Factory
    * Abstract Factory
    * Singleton
    * Builder
    * Prototype
* Structural DP
    * Adaptor
    * Bridge
    * Composition
    * Decorator (Sub-classing)
    * Facade
    * Flyweight
    * Proxy
* Behavioral DP
    * Chain of Responsibility
    * Command
    * Interpreter
    * Iterator
    * Mediator
    * Momento
    * Observer
    * State
    * Strategy
    * Template Method
    * Visitor 
* Includes...
    * organization around theory
    * the why behind and
    * many demonstrations (hands on coding)
* Outcome
    * understand the fundamentals of DPs
    * create Java apps that use DPs
    * master the art of problem solving in programming using efficient, proven and right methods (approaches)
    * learn how to write high quality Java code - modular, high cohesion and low coupling
    * become proficient in basic design principles
    * enjoy & have fun!
